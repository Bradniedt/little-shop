# Little Shop of Electronics

## Introduction
Introduction paragraph here, including why the project exists, briefly what it does, and how it works. 
Include a screenshot of e.g. the splash page or the items index page or something representative.
A link to the Turing project spec would make sense here too!
Can take a look at the Turing spec README/requirements for some ideas too: https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little_shop_v2

## Installation
If someone wanted to download this and get it up and running, how would they do that? 
Include database creation and initialization, ruby/rails versions
Might include a few subheaders, below:

#### System Dependencies

#### Running Tests
Subheader to above - how does someone run the test suite? 

## Built With
What technologies did we use? E.g. Ruby/Rails versions, PostgreSQL, testing software, highlight any gems (bcrypt, factorybot, ?). Maybe this would also be a reasonable place to mention using Waffle as a project management tool?

## Features
What kind of cool stuff does this do?? 
This seems like a good spot to include more screenshots. 
A screenshot of the schema (the pretty picture version) might be good here, talking about the database. 

## Authors
Us! Names and maybe links to e.g. our respective GitHubs and LinkedIns (if we're all comfortable with that)

## Acknowledgements
Optional, but anyone we want to acknowledge in particular? Maybe shoutouts to Dione and Ian?

## Links
Links that are related to the project. Probably the project spec/user stories (maybe also above in intro), Turing general site, .... anything else that would make sense. Resources we found especially helpful?

## License ???
I'm not sure that this is really necessary here, normally this would be where you would say what license the software is available under.
